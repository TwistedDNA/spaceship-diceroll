##### TL;DR
Eclipse spaceship battle simulator and statistics. 
Run MultiShipBattleRunner for example.

##### Background
This project emerged after intense weekend of board game action.
Among others, [Eclipse](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/72125/eclipse) brought lots of fun.
In this game spaceship battle results are based on dice rolls with modifications from ship upgrades. 
So I decided to make a simulation to help foresee my chances before going into hopeless fight.

##### Features
Multi ship battles are shown in MultiShipBattleRunner class. Primitive damage mealing 
strategy makes this simulation not exactly accurate. 

##### Planned improvements
Find formula to predict battle results more precisely.
Implement more efficient damage dealing strategy.
